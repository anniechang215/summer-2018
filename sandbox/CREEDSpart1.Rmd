Read in CREEDS data
```{r}
# Genes: Manual and Auto
gene_pert_manual <- read.csv("data/single_gene_perturbations-v1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
gene_pert_auto <- read.csv("data/single_gene_perturbations-p1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Drugs: Manual and Auto
drug_pert_manual <- read.csv("data/single_drug_perturbations-v1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
drug_pert_auto <- read.csv("data/single_drug_perturbations-p1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Diseases: Manual and Auto
disease_pert_manual <- read.csv("data/disease_signatures-v1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
disease_pert_auto <- read.csv("data/disease_signatures-p1.0.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

What are the rows?
# The rows are the numbers corresponding to all of the genes studied in the study.
```{r}
rownames(gene_pert_manual)
colnames(gene_pert_manual)
```
Which is a unique identifier?
# The ID is a unique identifier
# LOOK AT COMMANDS IN R:
Which identifiers can be found in multiple places?
# Cell type, curator, GEO ID, HS Gene Symbol, MM Gene Symbol, Pert Type, Platform

What are the columns?
# The columns are the labels that contain information about each gene!
How are the columns different between the manual and curated data?
# The manually curated data contains more information. It has labels including umls_cui, do_id, and curator.
How are the columns different between different types of data?
# Depending on whether it is a disease, drug, or gene, the data contains slightly different labels.

What are elements separated by?
# not sure. Commas?
  
Count how many drug_name, pert_ids, and ctrl_ids are in each row:
# Write a function to count the # of IDs in a field (input: string, output: number of IDs in string)
# Returns a list of the number of IDs for all the genes in the study for a specific field
```{r}
allNumIDs <- sapply(fileNames, function(fileName, field)) {
    # splits the term in the field into individual IDs
    allIDs <- strsplit(fileName$field, "|")
    # returns the total number of terms in the field
    return length(allIDs)
}

sapply(df$col, function(e1)) {
  
}
# How to call the function specifically for the filename and field? Esp. b/c it works through sapply.

```
Add three columns: ndrugs, npert, nctl to the data frame
# Use mutate() to do this

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {}
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

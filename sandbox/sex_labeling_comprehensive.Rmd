(Attempts to) sex label non cell-line GPL570 studies and compare amongst ALE, massiR, and Toker

```{r}
isViable <- function(geo_id) {
  if (overlap_file_studies$geo_id %in% viableStudies$Var1) {
    overlap_file_studies$moreThanSix <- TRUE
  }
  else {
    print("pineapple")
    overlap_file_studies$moreThanSix <- FALSE
  }
}
```

```{r}
### Download sample-level file
require('tidyverse')
overlap_file <- read.csv("/Users/anniechang/Desktop/Research/project/CREEDS_ALE_overlap.csv")

### Filter for non-cell line GPL570 samples
overlap_file_studies <- filter(overlap_file, (is.na(cell_line) | cell_line == FALSE) & (platform.new == 'GPL570'))

overlap_file_studies$geo_id <- as.character(overlap_file_studies$geo_id) # must change this class
tab <- as.data.frame(table(overlap_file_studies$geo_id)) # gets the number of samples associated with each study
viableStudies <- filter(tab, Freq >= 6) # gets studies with 6 or more samples

#### add a column indicating whether the study has more than 6 samples (T) or not (F)
#sapply(overlap_file_studies$geo_id, test) # a test function lol
overlap_file_studies$moreThanSix <- sapply(overlap_file_studies, isViable)

## Automate the sex labeling to run study by study
sapply(unique(overlap_file_studies$geo_id), getSexLabelsFinal)

### Add a column with sex labels using massiR


### Add another column with sex labels using Toker method
